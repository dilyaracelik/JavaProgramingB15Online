    TEAM CAPACITY= testers number * 8

    interview question:
            1. If i give you a requirement how test? what is your approach for testing that requirement/
    Requirement = User story

    positive scenario --> happy path
    what you do if expected result is not matching with actual result.
    test case vs test script
    test case --> manual testing
    test script --> automation testing.

            1. STLC --> How many steps include ? what are they
2. what activities should be done in first step of STLC (Requirment analysis)?

            5. how to create test case?
            6. which tools use for manual testing?
