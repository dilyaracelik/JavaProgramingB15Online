  /**  Common data processing in real life
    Scenario 1 :
    If I ask you tell me your state so I can store :
    first I did not care about duplicates
    I would just created a List and keep adding all your state into it
    Scenario 2 :
    then I realize there are many students from same states
    and I want to only store the unique states you are from
    so I need some kind of data structure already does it for me
    so I dont have to use bunch of if statements to handle it
    Set interface is a data structure for unique element
	if I wanted to keep the sorted order
            SortedSet
    Scenario 3 :
    now I want to actually store the student-state pair
    so i can get the state by student name :
    Michael : Virginia
    Map interface
	if I wanted to keep the sorted order
            SortedMap
    Scenario 4 :
    I want to answer the questions I got from the students
    but I want to answer them in the order I received
    so First come first serve based !!
    Queue
